                    <h3> "Mimi's Tangled Tale" </h3>
                    <hr />
                    <p> I work with children, so it made the most sense to create a childrens book. I also love to draw! This story entails
                        a basset hound named "Mimi" who has very large ears. People make fun of her ears, and every time she becomes embarassed
                        her ears grow larger! And larger! Until she's all tangled up. Lukily her good friend Danny reminds her why she should
                        love her ears. With the more kind words Mimi recieves her ears start to return to their normal size! It just goes to show
                        no matter what life throws your way, don't get tangled up.
